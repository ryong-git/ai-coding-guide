### Video Analysis Execution Process

#### Step 1: Initial Overview (5 minutes per video)
1. **Title and Description Analysis**
   - Extract main topic and promise
   - Identify target audience
   - Note any specific tools mentioned
   - Record any performance claims

2. **Quick Scan for Structure**
   - Skip through video at 2x speed
   - Identify major sections and transitions
   - Note timestamps of key demonstrations
   - Mark sections with obvious code/tools

#### Step 2: Detailed Technical Analysis (30-45 minutes per video)
1. **Segment-by-Segment Review**
   - Watch each segment at normal speed
   - Pause at every technical demonstration
   - Record exact tool names and versions
   - Screenshot configuration screens

2. **Code Extraction**
   - Pause at every code example
   - Transcribe code exactly as shown
   - Note syntax highlighting and IDE
   - Record any error messages or outputs

3. **Performance Claims Documentation**
   - Note any speed improvements mentioned
   - Record specific metrics (percentages, times)
   - Document before/after scenarios
   - Verify claims seem realistic

#### Step 3: MSP Context Mapping (15 minutes per video)
1. **Individual → Team Translation**
   - How would this work with multiple developers?
   - What team coordination would be needed?
   - How to standardize across team members?
   - What training would be required?

2. **Client Environment Adaptation**
   - How does this apply to customer projects?
   - What modifications for enterprise environments?
   - Compliance and security considerations?
   - Scalability implications?
